								<p>I'm no engineer but since being the Vice President and Team Captain for the Jamaica College Robotics Team I've always had 
									a deep interest in STEM and I think robotics programs like first truly give young individuals like myself an oppurtunity to 
									develop that interest. I think that my time in that program has played a huge part in shaping my career. 
								</p>
								
								<p>I've learnt valuable skills in teamwork from being apart of the robotics team and still have a great relationship with all my fellow team members.</p>
								<h2>Fitness and Health </h2>

								<p>I was inspired to become involved in the fitnes because I was always a sickly child and didn't have alot 
									of oppurtunties to be involved in sports without my health holding me back, but now in my adult life I've taken 
									every oppurutnity to become more active and I now regularly go to the gym. I've developed good 
									discipline from this experience.

								<h2> Music </h2>

								<p>	I've always had a deep passion for music of all genres.My love for music has only gotten 
									better since I've started using Spotify,the wide selection of music they offer, along with the 
									recommendations has oepened me up to a whole range of different music. I plan to start learning the 
									ukulele and I used to play africans drums as apart of UTECH Drumming Ensemble.
