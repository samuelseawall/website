								<p>While I may not possess an engineering background, my involvement as both the Vice President and Team Captain of the Jamaica College Robotics Team has deeply kindled my passion for STEM. I am a firm believer in the transformative potential of robotics programs like FIRST, as they provide young individuals, much like myself, with invaluable opportunities to cultivate their interests. Undoubtedly, my participation in this program has been a significant driving force in shaping the course of my career. 
								</p>
								
								<p>I've learnt valuable skills in teamwork from being apart of the robotics team and still have a great relationship with all my fellow team members.</p>

								<p>My journey into fitness was driven by a past marked by health challenges during my childhood. These obstacles limited my participation in sports and physical activities. However, as an adult, I've made it my mission to embrace a more active lifestyle, seizing every chance to engage in physical pursuits. Today, I'm committed to regular gym sessions, a testament to the transformative power of determination and perseverance. This ongoing endeavor has not only boosted my physical well-being but also instilled within me a remarkable sense of discipline.

								<p>	My profound passion for music spans across various genres. Since embracing Spotify, my adoration for music has only deepened. The platform's extensive selection and its insightful recommendations have introduced me to a diverse musical world. Moreover, I hold a keen fascination for the data science intricacies underlying Spotify's personalized music suggestions. As part of my musical journey, I'm gearing up to learn the ukulele, adding to my repertoire that already includes playing African drums as a member of the UTECH Drumming Ensemble.
