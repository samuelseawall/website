								<h2>SQL and other Programming Languages</h2>  

								<p>I've started learning SQL and when I start developing projects they'll be uploaded to Kaggle.I look 
									foward to developing and growing my analyst tool kit as a young professional. 
								</p>
							
								<h2>Excel</h2>

								<p>Excel is my go to tool for data analytics and this is because 
									of how much value it can generate while being very simple and easy to get 
									started with. I've done ABC Analysis, Sales Forecasting,Analyzed Customer Buying Patterns,Sales Trends
									and Demand Analytics. I have some knowledge of VBA as well and use it when I can.
									
									I've also developed a system of managing inventory when I worked at KWL it was used 
									to track the movement of cars from one car park to another and for transshipment units. 
									It primarily used the Match and IF function for its core functionality. 
			
								</p>

								<h2> Problem Solving  </h2>
								
								<p>	I think problem solving is the skill that has allowed me to 
									learn and grow in my previous roles. I'll use an example, in my 
									previous role and Kingston Wharves Limited the problem that needed 
									to be solved was how can we keep track of the motor vehicle inventory ? 
									I had started learning excel in perparation for the role and felt like it had 
									the capablities to track the movements. I had to work with team members of the planning 
									department to get an understanding of how the information should be presented and how it could 
									be tracked and ultimaitely came up with a solution that while not perfect served a purpose and 
									was useful in operations.
